1. Create a XML file representing catalogue. The
catalogue should contain albums of different artists.
For each album you should define: name, artist,
year, producer, price and a list of songs. Each
song should be described by title and duration.
2. Write program that extracts all different artists
which are found in the catalog.xml. For each
author you should print the number of albums in the
catalogue. Use the DOM parser and a hash-table.
3. Implement the previous using XPath.
4. Using the DOM parser write a program to delete
from catalog.xml all albums having price > 20.
5. Write a program, which using XmlReader extracts
all song titles from catalog.xml.
6. Rewrite the same using XDocument and LINQ query.
7. In a text file we are given the name, address and
phone number of given person (each at a single line).
Write a program, which creates new XML document,
which contains these data in structured XML format.
8. Write a program, which (using XmlReader and
XmlWriter) reads the file catalog.xml and creates
the file album.xml, in which stores in appropriate
way the names of all albums and their authors.
9. Write a program to traverse given directory and
write to a XML file its contents together with all
subdirectories and files. Use tags <file> and <dir>
with appropriate attributes. For the generation of
the XML document use the class XmlWriter.
10. Rewrite the last exercises using XDocument,
XElement and XAttribute.
11. Write a program, which extract from the file
catalog.xml the prices for all albums, published 5
years ago or earlier. Use XPath query.
12. Rewrite the previous using LINQ query.
13. Create an XSL stylesheet, which transforms the file
catalog.xml into HTML document, formatted for
viewing in a standard Web-browser.
14. Write a C# program to apply the XSLT stylesheet
transformation on the file catalog.xml using the
class XslTransform.
15. * Read some tutorial about the XQuery language.
Implement the XML to HTML transformation with
XQuery (instead of XSLT). Download some open
source XQuery library for .NET and execute the
XQuery to transform the catalog.xml to HTML.
15. Using Visual Studio generate an XSD schema for the
file catalog.xml. Write a C# program that takes an
XML file and an XSD file (schema) and validates the
XML file against the schema. Test it with valid XML
catalogs and invalid XML catalogs.
