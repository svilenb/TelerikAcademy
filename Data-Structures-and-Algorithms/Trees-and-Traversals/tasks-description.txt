1. You are given a tree of N nodes represented as a set
of N-1 pairs of nodes (parent node, child node), each
in the range (0..N-1).

Write a program to read
the tree and find:
a) the root node
b) all leaf nodes
c) all middle nodes
d) the longest path in the tree
e) * all paths in the tree with given sum S of their nodes
f) * all subtrees with given sum S of their nodes

2. Write a program to traverse the directory
C:\WINDOWS and all its subdirectories recursively and
to display all files matching the mask *.exe. Use the
class System.IO.Directory.
3. Define classes File { string name, int size } and
Folder { string name, File[] files, Folder[]
childFolders } and using them build a tree keeping
all files and folders on the hard drive starting from
C:\WINDOWS. Implement a method that calculates
the sum of the file sizes in given subtree of the tree
and test it accordingly. Use recursive DFS traversal.
