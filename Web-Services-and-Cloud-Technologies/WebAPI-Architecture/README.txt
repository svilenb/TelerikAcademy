1. Finish the GameResult to determine the winner (unit test it well)
2. Create two more services by your choice - it may be some leaderboards, game options, game passwords, etc.

I am using .\SQLEXPRESS for the data source of the connection string.

The additional services I made are the leaderboards, getting all available games and joining a game by id.
